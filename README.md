# Optimising-Recruitment-Strategies-for-Cost-Efficiency- TedSquare Ltd

TedSquare Ltd. faced financial constraints due to the pandemic, requiring more efficient and cost-effective hiring methods. I analyzed recruitment data to identify the most cost-efficient channels, assessing their benefits, risks, and impact. I compared findings with global trends to ensure competitiveness and explored alternative strategies. As a result, my recommendations helped the company optimize recruitment processes, reduce costs, and maintain the quality of hires, supporting more informed HR budgeting decisions.
